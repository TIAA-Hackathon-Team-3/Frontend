Title: Social Network like Quora
Description:
Create an app or website in which users should be able to create posts based in various categories and other users can respond over the posts
using comments, upvotes and downvotes.
MVP Scope:
1. User interface for users to register.
2. User should be able to create posts with max character limit of 2000.
3. Users should be able to provide responses over a post by comments, up votes, and down votes.
4. Home page should list posts with highest upvotes based on various categories.
5. Categories for post can be Technology, Lifestyle, Politics, Food, Economics, Sports etc.
6. Users should be able to tag other users in responses.
7. User should be able to send direct messages to other users, just like internet messengers.

Step 1: Define the Technology Stack For the development of an app or website like Quora, we can use the following technology stack:

Front-end: React.js, HTML/CSS

Back-end: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

Step 2: Design the User Interface Design the user interface for user registration, post creation, response to a post, tagging users in responses, direct messaging, and displaying the posts based on upvotes.

Step 3: User Registration Create a user registration page where users can sign up using their email address and password.

Step 4: Post Creation Create a page for users to create posts with a maximum character limit of 2000. Users should be able to select a category for their post, such as Technology, Lifestyle, Politics, Food, Economics, Sports, etc.

Step 5: Response to a Post Users should be able to respond to a post by commenting, upvoting, and downvoting. Comments should be shown in a threaded view, with the ability to reply to a specific comment.

Step 6: Tagging Users in Responses Users should be able to tag other users in their responses. This feature can be implemented using an auto-complete feature where users can search for other users and tag them in their response.

Step 7: Direct Messaging Users should be able to send direct messages to other users, just like internet messengers. This feature can be implemented using a messaging system with real-time updates.

Step 8: Display Posts Based on Upvotes The home page should display the most upvoted posts in each category. Users should be able to sort the posts based on various criteria, such as most recent, most upvoted, etc.

Step 9: Testing and Deployment The app or website should be thoroughly tested before deployment. Once the testing is complete, the app or website can be deployed to a server.

Conclusion: By following the above steps, we can create an app or website like Quora where users can create posts, respond to posts, tag other users, and send direct messages. With the help of advanced technologies like Node.js and React.js, we can create a fast, responsive, and feature-rich app or website that users will love.
